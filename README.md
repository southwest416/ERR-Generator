8. This will generate a folder "Filled ERRs". Open this folder to view your completed ERR packages. You can then view and print the generated documents from Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Adobe Acrobat.

9. Review each package THOROUGHLY, especially if your current or desired facility has undergone a change recently such as a change of type, level, etc.

10. If you did not attach signatures earlier, sign the cover letter, 3330-42 (page 2), and 3330-43-1 (page 5), and have a supervisor or manager sign 3330-43-1 under "Signature of Rating Official."
If you did not attach your resume and performance plan earlier, attach them now.

11. Fax or email to the region generated on the cover letter!
