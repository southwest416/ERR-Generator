6a. When attaching signatures, it is recommended to attach both an image of your signature and a signed 3330-43-1 page, if desired. If you attach a signed 3330-43-1 page 2, please double check it is filled out completely and correctly prior to attaching, as the generator will not attempt to fill any fields on this document once attached. **Do NOT attach a 3330-43-1 page 2 that has already been signed by a rating official, as reusing a document signed by someone else may be a violation of policy, law, or regulation. Only attach a page that has been signed by you, and nobody else.**
   
7. Once you have attached all the files you want, use the "Run" button at the bottom to generate your ERRs.

8. This will generate a folder "Filled ERRs". Open this folder to view your completed ERR packages. If you filled out the 1b. USAJOBS Announcement sheet, this will also generate a folder "Filled USAJOBS 3330-43-1". You can then view and print the generated documents from Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Adobe Acrobat.
**Please do not print from Mozilla Firefox as it will not function properly when attempting to print.**

9. Review each package THOROUGHLY, especially if your current or desired facility has undergone a change recently such as a change of type, level, etc.

10. If you did not attach signatures earlier, sign the cover letter, 3330-42 (page 2), and 3330-43-1 (page 5), and have a supervisor or manager sign 3330-43-1 under "Signature of Rating Official."
If you did not attach your resume and performance plan earlier, attach them now.

11. Fax or email to the region generated on the cover letter!
